    "text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current plans, expectations, and beliefs, involving risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. You should review the section titled \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d for a discussion of forward-looking statements and the section titled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d for a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any period in the future. This section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K generally discusses fiscal years 2023 and 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between fiscal years 2023 and 2022. Discussions of fiscal year 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between fiscal years 2022 and 2021 that are not included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K can be found in Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, which was filed with the SEC on February 21, 2023 and is incorporated herein by reference. Overview   We build software that empowers organizations to effectively integrate their data, decisions, and operations at scale. We were founded in 2003 and started building software for the intelligence community in the United States to assist in counterterrorism investigations and operations. We later began working with commercial enterprises, who often faced fundamentally similar challenges in working with data. We have built four principal software platforms, Gotham, Foundry, Apollo, and our Artificial Intelligence Platform (\u201cAIP\u201d). Gotham and Foundry enable institutions to transform massive amounts of information into an integrated data asset that reflects their operations, and AIP leverages the power of our existing machine learning technologies alongside large language models (\u201cLLMs\u201d) directly within Gotham and/or Foundry to help connect AI to enterprise data. For over a decade, Gotham has surfaced insights for global defense agencies, the intelligence community, disaster relief organizations and beyond. Foundry is   becoming a central operating system not only for individual institutions but also for entire industries.",

    "text": "Apollo, which we began offering as a commercial solution in 2021, is a cloud-agnostic, single control layer that coordinates ongoing delivery of new features, security updates, and platform configurations, helping to ensure the continuous operation of critical systems. Apollo allows our customers to run their software in virtually any environment. In 2023, we began deploying our newest offering, AIP, which is designed for customers across the commercial and government sectors, enabling them to derive value from recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence via the combination of our existing software platforms with LLMs. We believe AIP uniquely allows users to connect LLMs and other AI with their data and operations to facilitate decision-making within the legal, ethical, and security constraints that they require. While our focus in the short term remains on making our software platforms available to increasingly broad swaths of the market, we are also working to identify additional component parts and products embedded within those platforms that have potential as commercial offerings on their own. We believe that every institution faces challenges that our platforms and products were designed to address. Our approach with all our clients is to establish a partnership that transforms the way they use data in pursuit of their goals. We regularly evaluate partnerships and investment opportunities in complementary businesses, employee teams, technologies, and intellectual property rights in an effort to expand our product and service offerings. Our Business   Our customers pay us to use the software platforms we have built. While we generally offer contract terms of one to five years in length, our customers sometimes enter into shorter-term contracts. Revenue is generally recognized ratably over the contract term. Many of our customer contracts contain termination for convenience provisions. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we generated $2.2 billion in revenue, reflecting a 17% growth rate from the year ended December 31, 2022, when we generated $1.9 billion in revenue. In the year ended December 31, 2023, we generated income from operations of $120.0 million, or adjusted income from operations of $632.8 million when excluding stock-based compensation and related employer payroll taxes. In the year ended December 31, 2022, our losses from operations were $161.2 million, or adjusted income from operations of $420.8 million when excluding stock-based compensation and related employer payroll taxes. In the year ended December 31, 2023, our gross profit was $1.8 billion, reflecting a gross margin of 81%, or 82% when excluding stock-based compensation. In the year ended December 31, 2022, our gross profit was $1.5 billion, reflecting a gross margin of 79%, or 81% when excluding stock-based compensation.",

Our Customers   We define a customer as an organization from which we have recognized revenue during the trailing twelve-month period. During the period ended December 31, 2023, we had 497 customers, including companies in various commercial sectors and government agencies around the world. During the period ended December 31, 2022, we had 367 customers. For large government agencies, where a single institution has multiple divisions, units, or subsidiary agencies, each such division, unit, or subsidiary agency that enters into a separate contract with us and is invoiced as a separate entity is treated as a separate customer. For example, while the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and National Institutes of Health are subsidiary agencies of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, we treat each of those agencies as a separate customer given that the governing structures and procurement processes of each agency are independent. We have built lasting and significant customer relationships and partnerships with some of the world\u2019s leading government institutions and companies. As of December 31, 2023, we expect to generate revenue from contracts closed during the year ended December 31, 2023 for an additional 3.4 years on a dollar-weighted average contract duration basis. Dollar-weighted average contract duration represents the length of time we expect to generate revenue on average, based on the total potential lifetime length and value of contracts entered into with, or awarded by, our customers at the time of contract execution, presuming that our customers will exercise all of the contractual options available to them and no termination of contracts,   although the majority of our contracts are subject to termination provisions, including for convenience, and there can be no guarantee that contracts are not terminated or that contract options will be exercised. We calculate this duration on a dollar-weighted basis to adjust for smaller deals. The timing of our customer billings and receipt of payments varies from contract to contract. Our average revenue for the top twenty customers during the trailing twelve months ended December 31, 2023 was $54.6 million, which grew 11% from an average of $49.4 million in revenue from the top twenty customers during the trailing twelve months ended December 31, 2022, demonstrating our expanding relationships with existing customers. Organizations in the commercial and government sectors face similar challenges when it comes to managing data, and we intend to expand our reach in both markets moving forward.",

    "text": "Our decisions about which customer relationships require further investment may change over time, based on our assessment of the potential long-term value that our software can generate for them. We conduct pilots and bootcamps with customers, generally at our own expense and without a guarantee of future returns, in order to access a unique set of opportunities that others may pass over for lack of resources and shorter investment horizons. We manage customers at the account level, not by industry or sector, so that we can optimize on the specific growth opportunities for each customer. In the year ended December 31, 2023, 55% of our revenue came from government customers and 45% came from commercial customers. Our U.S. customers have been a meaningful source of revenue growth for our business. In the year ended December 31, 2023, we generated 62% of our revenue from customers in the United States and the remaining 38% from non-U.S. customers. Revenue from our U.S. customers during the trailing twelve months ended December 31, 2023 was $1.4 billion, which grew 19% from the prior twelve-month period. We expect that U.S. customers will continue to be a source of significant revenue growth for us. We continue to believe that our government customers remain a meaningful and resilient source of revenue for our business, particularly during periods of economic uncertainty. However, large government customers in particular are generally subject to a number of uncertainties regarding budgets and spending levels, changes in timing and spending priorities, and regulatory and policy changes, which can make it difficult to predict when, or if, we will make sales to such customers or the size and scope of any contract awards. See also the discussion of \u201c Risks Related to Relationships and Business with the Public Sector\u201d within \u201c Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Expansion of Access to Platforms   The speed with which our platforms can be deployed has significantly expanded the range of potential customers with which we plan on partnering over the long term. We anticipate that our reach among an increasingly broad set of customers, in both the commercial and government sectors, will accelerate moving forward. We believe that, as these new partners grow, we will grow with them. Our proximity to these businesses and the industries in which they are operating has enhanced, and is expected to continue enhancing, our own product and business development efforts, as we continue expanding access to our platforms to the broadest possible set of customers. Total Remaining Deal Value   We are focused on building strategic relationships with, and delivering significant outcomes for, our customers over the long term. Our contracts with our customers reflect that long-term orientation, often lasting for multiple years at a time.",

Total remaining deal value presumes the exercise of all contract options available to our customers and no termination of contracts. However, the majority of our contracts are subject to termination provisions, including for convenience, and there can be no guarantee that contracts are not terminated or that contract options will be exercised. Further, total remaining deal value may exclude all or some portion of the value of certain commercial contracts as a result of our ongoing assessments of customers\u2019 financial condition, including the consideration of such customers\u2019 ability and intention to pay, and whether such contracts continue to meet the criteria for revenue recognition, among other factors. As of December 31, 2023, the total remaining deal value of the contracts, as defined above, was $3.9 billion, up 5% from December 31, 2022, when our total remaining deal value of such contracts was $3.7 billion. Of our total remaining deal value, as of December 31, 2023, the total remaining deal value of the contracts that we entered into with commercial customers, including existing contractual obligations and available contractual options, as defined above, was $2.1 billion, up 7% from December 31, 2022, when the total remaining deal value of such contracts was $2.0 billion. As of December 31, 2023, the total remaining deal value of the contracts that we had been awarded by government agencies in the United States and allied countries around the world, including existing contractual obligations and contractual options available to those government agencies, was $1.8 billion, up 4% from December 31, 2022, when the total value of such contracts was $1.7 billion. When calculating the total remaining deal value of government contracts, we do not include government contracts known as IDIQ contracts, totaling $4.1 billion, as of December 31, 2023, that we have been awarded, but where the funding of such contracts has not yet been determined. The funding of these contracts is not guaranteed. Many of our government and commercial contracts are subject to termination for convenience provisions. Additionally, the U.S. federal government is prohibited from exercising contract options more than one year in advance. As a result, there can be no guarantee that our customer contracts will not be terminated or that contract options will be exercised. Macroeconomic Trends   As a corporation with an international presence, we are subject to risks and uncertainties caused by significant events with macroeconomic impacts, including, but not limited to, geopolitical tensions, heightened interest rates, monetary policy changes, and foreign currency fluctuations.",

    "text": "Additionally, these macroeconomic impacts have disrupted, and may continue to disrupt, the operations of our customers and prospective customers. We continuously monitor the direct and indirect impacts of these circumstances on our business and financial results, as well as the overall global economy and geopolitical landscape. See the section titled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of the impact of macroeconomic trends on our business. Geopolitical Tensions   Our business operations are subject to interruption by events that are beyond our control, including geopolitical tensions. We continue to closely monitor the impact of various geopolitical tensions and their global impacts on our business. While the ongoing Russia-Ukraine and Israel conflicts are still evolving and the outcomes remain highly uncertain, we do not expect that resulting challenging macroeconomic conditions will have a material impact on our business or results of operations. We do not currently have office locations in Russia or Palestinian territories and none of our revenues came from sales to entities headquartered in those countries or territories. In 2023, we announced partnerships with Ukraine to support its defense and reconstruction efforts and investigations of potential war crimes, among other activities. In 2024, we agreed to a strategic partnership with the Israeli Defense Ministry to supply technology to Israel to assist in the ongoing war. However, our current operations related to Ukraine and Israel are not material to our financial position or results of operations. If the respective conflicts continue or worsen, leading to greater disruptions and uncertainty within the technology industry or global economy, our business and results of operations could be negatively impacted. Foreign Currency Exchange Rates   Exchange rates are subject to significant and rapid fluctuations due to a number of factors, including interest rate changes, monetary policy changes, and political and economic uncertainty which may adversely affect our results of operations or financial position. Our contracts with customers and vendors are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. However, the general strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other major foreign currencies (primarily the Euro and GBP) has had, and could in the future have, an unfavorable impact on our revenues and expenses from certain non-U.S. customers or vendors whose contracts are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Additionally, certain of our U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries may hold monetary assets and liabilities in currencies other than their functional currency (primarily the JPY, Euro, and GBP), which could subject our results of operations and cash flows to adverse fluctuations due to changes in such foreign currency exchange rates as compared to the U.S. dollar.",

    "text": "For the year ended December 31, 2023, such impacts were not material to our financial position or results of operations. Customer Impacts   Current macroeconomic conditions have impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, our customers\u2019 businesses, particularly our early- and growth-stage customers. Relationships with early- or growth-stage customers carry inherent risks because, among other things, such customers may be unable to generate sufficient revenues or profitability or to access any necessary financing or funding in a timely manner or on favorable terms to them in the current macroeconomic environment, which has impacted, and may continue to impact, our expected revenue and collections. As a result, current macroeconomic conditions have impacted, and may continue to impact, our ability to realize the full value of our commercial contracts with   such early- or growth-stage customers. For additional information, see Note 4. Investments and Fair Value Measurements in the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Key Business Measure   In addition to the measures presented in our consolidated financial statements, we use the following key non-GAAP business measure to help us evaluate our business, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans and financial projections, and make strategic decisions. Contribution Margin   We believe that the revenue we generate relative to the costs we incur in order to generate such revenue is an important measure of the efficiency of our business. We define contribution margin as revenue less our cost of revenue and sales and marketing expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, divided by revenue. Revenue is allocated to each customer account directly. The cost of revenue and sales and marketing costs include both the costs associated with the deployment and operation of our software as well as expenses associated with identifying new customers and expanding partnerships with existing ones. Our software engineers working with existing customers often manage the deployment and operation of our platforms as well as identify new ways that those platforms can be used. To calculate the contribution by segment, we allocate cost of revenue and sales and marketing expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, to an account pro rata based on headcount and time spent on the account during the period. To the extent certain costs or personnel are not directly assigned to a specific account, they are allocated pro rata based on total headcount staffed during such period. Direct costs, such as third-party cloud hosting services, are directly allocated to the account to which they relate. Allocated revenues and expenses are then aggregated into a segment based upon the customer account to which they relate.",

    "text": "Contribution margin, both across our business and segments, is intended to capture how much we have earned from customers after accounting for the costs associated with deploying and operating our software, as well as any sales and marketing expenses involved in acquiring and expanding our partnerships with those customers, including allocated overhead. We exclude stock-based compensation as it is a noncash expense. We believe that our contribution margin provides an important measure of the efficiency of our operations over time. We have included contribution margin because it is a key measure used by our management to evaluate our performance, and we believe that it also provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management team. Our calculation of contribution margin may differ from similarly titled measures, if any, reported by other companies. Contribution margin should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. For more information about contribution margin, including the limitations of this measure, and a reconciliation to loss from operations, see the section titled \u201cNon-GAAP Reconciliations\u201d below. Non-GAAP Reconciliations   We use the non-GAAP measures contribution margin; gross profit and gross margin, excluding stock-based compensation; and adjusted income from operations, which excludes stock-based compensation and related employer payroll taxes, to help us evaluate our business, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans and financial projections, and make strategic decisions. We exclude stock-based compensation, which is a noncash expense, from these non-GAAP financial measures because we believe that excluding this item provides meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management team. Additionally, we exclude employer payroll taxes related to stock-based compensation as it is difficult to predict and outside of our control. Our definitions may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. In addition, other companies may not publish these or similar metrics. Further, these metrics have certain limitations, as they do not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our consolidated statements of operations. Thus, our non-GAAP contribution margin; gross profit and gross margin, excluding stock-based compensation; and adjusted income from operations should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. We compensate for these limitations by providing reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures.",

Palantir Cloud   Our Palantir Cloud subscriptions grant customers the right to access the software functionality in a hosted environment controlled by Palantir and are sold together with stand-ready O&M services, as further described below. We agree to provide   continuous access to our hosted software throughout the contract term. Revenue associated with Palantir Cloud subscriptions is generally recognized over the contract term on a ratable basis, which is consistent with the transfer of control of the Palantir services to the customer. On-Premises Software   Sales of our software subscriptions grant customers the right to use functional intellectual property, either on their internal hardware infrastructure or on their own cloud instance, over the contractual term and are also sold together with stand-ready O&M services. O&M services include critical updates and support and maintenance services required to operate the software and, as such, are necessary for the software to maintain its intended utility over the contractual term. Because of this requirement, we have concluded that the software subscriptions and O&M services, which together we refer to as our On-Premises Software, are highly interdependent and interrelated and represent a single distinct performance obligation within the context of the contract. Revenue is generally recognized over the contract term on a ratable basis. Professional Services   Our professional services support the customers\u2019 use of the software and include, as needed, on-demand user support, user-interface configuration, training, and ongoing ontology and data modeling support. Professional services contracts typically include the provision of on-demand professional services for the duration of the contractual term. These services are typically coterminous with a Palantir Cloud or On-Premises Software subscriptions. Professional services are on-demand, whereby we perform services throughout the contract period; therefore, the revenue is recognized over the contractual term. Cost of Revenue   Cost of revenue primarily includes salaries, stock-based compensation expense, and benefits for personnel involved in performing O&M and professional services, as well as field-service representatives, third-party cloud hosting services, hardware costs, travel costs, allocated overhead, and other direct costs. We expect that cost of revenue will increase in absolute dollars as our revenue grows and will vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue.",

Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests   Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests represents the share of income (loss) that is not attributable to the Company. Segments   We have two operating segments, commercial and government, which were determined based on the manner in which the chief operating decision maker, who is our Chief Executive Officer, manages our operations for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating performance. Various factors, including our organizational and management reporting structure and customer type, were considered in determining these operating segments. Our operating segments are described below:   \u2022 Commercial: This segment primarily serves customers working in non-government industries. \u2022 Government: This segment primarily serves customers that are U.S. government and non-U.S. government agencies. Segment profitability is evaluated based on contribution and contribution margin. Contribution is segment revenue less the related costs of revenue and sales and marketing expenses, excluding stock-based compensation expense. Contribution margin is contribution divided by revenue. To the extent costs of revenue or sales and marketing expenses are not directly attributable to a particular segment, they are allocated based upon headcount at each operating segment during the period. We use it, in part, to evaluate the performance of, and allocate resources to, each of our operating segments, which excludes certain operating expenses that are not allocated to operating segments because they are separately managed at the consolidated corporate level, or are noncash costs. These unallocated or noncash costs include stock-based compensation expense, research and development costs, and general and administrative costs, such as legal and accounting costs.",

Income Taxes in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Liquidity and Capital Resources   We generated positive cash flow from operations for the year ended December 31, 2023. We had cash, cash equivalents, and short-term U.S. treasury securities totaling $3.7 billion available as of December 31, 2023. We believe that cash flows generated from operations, cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, available funds, and access to financing sources, including our credit facility, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next twelve months. However, any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. We have historically generated significant losses from our operations as reflected in our consolidated balance sheets and while we have generated income from operations and positive cash flows from operations in the year ended December 31, 2023, the amounts may fluctuate for the foreseeable future. As of December 31, 2023, our accumulated deficit balance was $5.6 billion, and our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents, and short-term U.S. treasury securities totaling $3.7 billion. As of December 31, 2023, we had no outstanding debt balances and additional available and undrawn revolving commitments of $500.0 million under our credit facility. For more information, see Note 6. Debt in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to, the rate of our growth, our ability to attract and retain customers and their willingness and ability to pay for our products and services, and the timing and extent of spending to support our efforts to market and develop our products. Further, we may enter into future arrangements to acquire or invest in businesses, products, services, strategic partnerships, and technologies; additionally, we may repurchase shares of our Class A common stock from time to time under our Share Repurchase Program. As such, we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If additional funds are not available to us on acceptable terms, or at all, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.",

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control\u2014Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 20, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion   These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.",

The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.Revenue Recognition Description of the Matter As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company generates revenue from the sale of subscriptions to access its software platforms in the Company\u2019s hosted environment, along with ongoing operations and maintenance (\u201cO&M\u201d) services (\u201cPalantir Cloud\u201d); software licenses, primarily term licenses in the customers\u2019 environments, with ongoing O&M services (\u201cOn-Premises Software\u201d); and professional services. Management applies significant judgment in identifying and evaluating any non-standard terms and conditions in customer arrangements which may impact the determination of performance obligations or the timing of revenue recognition. In addition, determining whether promises are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately \u2013 or not distinct within the context of the contract and, thus, accounted for together \u2013 requires significant judgment. The Company concluded that the promise to provide a software license is highly interdependent and interrelated with the promise to provide O&M services and such promises are not distinct within the context of its contracts and are accounted for as a single performance obligation for the Company\u2019s On-Premises Software. Auditing revenue recognition was complex and required a significant level of auditor judgment to identify and evaluate non-standard terms and conditions that impact revenue recognition and to assess whether the software licenses and O&M services should be accounted for as distinct performance obligations or combined as a single performance obligation. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company\u2019s controls to identify and evaluate terms and conditions and performance obligations in customer arrangements that would impact revenue recognition.",

We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.",

    "text": "Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP   San Jose, California   February 20, 2024   Palantir Technologies Inc.",

Organization   Palantir Technologies Inc. (including its subsidiaries, \u201cPalantir\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) was incorporated in Delaware on May 6, 2003. The Company builds and deploys software platforms that serve as the central operating systems for its customers. 2. Significant Accounting Policies   Basis of Presentation and Consolidation   The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) and applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding annual financial reporting. The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Palantir Technologies Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Investments in entities where the Company holds at least a 20% ownership interest and has the ability to exercise significant influence over, but does not control, the investee are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Certain prior year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Such reclassifications did not affect total revenues, income (loss) from operations, net income (loss), or cash flows. The Company\u2019s fiscal year ends on December 31.   Use of Estimates   The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant estimates and assumptions made in the accompanying consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to, the identification of performance obligations in customer contracts, the valuation of deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions, and the collectability of contract consideration, including accounts receivable. Estimates and judgments are based on historical experience, forecasted events, and various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates and such differences could affect the Company\u2019s financial position and results of operations. Segments   The Company has two operating segments, commercial and government, which were determined based on the manner in which the chief operating decision maker (\u201cCODM\u201d), who is the Chief Executive Officer, manages the operations of the Company for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating performance.",

The Company\u2019s operating segments are described below:   \u2022 Commercial: This segment primarily serves customers working in non-government industries. \u2022 Government: This segment primarily serves customers that are United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) government and non-U.S. government agencies. Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash   The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents primarily consist of amounts invested in money market funds and available-for-sale debt securities. Restricted cash primarily consists of cash and certificates of deposit that are held as collateral against letters of credit and guarantees that the Company is required to maintain for operating lease agreements, certain customer contracts, and other guarantees and financing arrangements. The following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash reported within the consolidated balance sheets that sum to the total of the amounts shown in the consolidated statements of cash flows (in thousands):   Palantir Technologies Inc.

    "text": "Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses   Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount, net of an allowance for credit losses. The Company generally grants non-collateralized credit terms to its customers. Allowance for credit losses is based on the Company\u2019s best estimate of probable losses inherent in its accounts receivable portfolio and is determined based on expectations of the customer\u2019s ability to pay by considering factors such as customer type (commercial or government), historical experience, financial position of the customer, age of the accounts receivable, current economic conditions, and reasonable and supportable forward-looking factors about its portfolio and future economic conditions. Accounts receivable are written-off and charged against an allowance for credit losses when the Company has exhausted collection efforts without success. Based upon the Company\u2019s assessment as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded an allowance for credit losses of $ 10.5 million and $ 10.1 million, respectively. Debt Securities   Debt securities are primarily comprised of U.S. treasury securities. The debt securities are classified as available-for-sale at the time of purchase and are reevaluated as of each balance sheet date. The Company considers the majority of its available-for-sale debt securities as available for use in current operations and may sell these securities at any time, and therefore classifies these securities as current assets in its consolidated balance sheets. Debt securities included in marketable securities on the consolidated balance sheets consist of U.S. treasury securities with original maturities of greater than three months at the time of purchase, and the remaining U.S. treasury securities are included in cash and cash equivalents. Interest income on debt securities is included in other income (expense), net on the consolidated statements of operations. The majority of the Company\u2019s available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value each reporting period using quoted prices of similar instruments and are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The Company evaluates investments with unrealized loss positions for other than temporary impairment by assessing if they are related to deterioration in credit risk and whether it expects to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security, the Company\u2019s intent to sell, and whether it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the securities before the recovery of their cost basis. Credit-related impairment losses, not to exceed the amount that fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, are recognized in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. Unrealized gains and non-credit related losses are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net in the consolidated balance sheets until realized.",

Concentrations of Credit Risk   Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, marketable securities, and privately-held equity securities. Cash equivalents primarily consist of money market funds and U.S. treasury securities with original maturities of three months or less, which are invested primarily with U.S. financial institutions. Cash deposits with financial institutions, including restricted cash, generally exceed federally insured limits. Management believes minimal credit risk exists with respect to these financial institutions and the Company has not experienced any losses on such amounts. The Company is exposed to concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable presented in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company\u2019s accounts receivable balances as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 were $ 364.8 million and $ 258.3 million, respectively. Customer I represented 15 % of total accounts receivable as of December 31, 2023, and no other customer represented more than 10% of total accounts receivable as of December 31, 2023. No customer represented more than 10% of total accounts receivable as of December 31, 2022.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)   Alternative Investments   Alternative investments include gold bars and are recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets. The investments are initially recorded at cost and subsequently remeasured at the lower of cost or market each reporting period. Market value is determined by using quoted market prices of identical or similar assets from active markets. Unrealized losses are recorded in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. Realized gains and losses are recorded in other income (expense), net upon realization. Property and Equipment, Net   Property and equipment, net are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is recognized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, which are generally three years . Leasehold improvements are capitalized and amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful life, which is generally five years . Maintenance and repairs that do not improve or extend the useful lives of the assets are expensed when incurred.",

Privately-held Equity Securities   Equity securities in privately-held companies without readily determinable fair values are recorded using the measurement alternative. Such investments are carried at cost, less any impairments, and are adjusted for subsequent observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. Changes in the basis of the equity securities are recognized in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. Business Combinations   Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) 805, Business Combinations, and are included in our consolidated financial statements from their respective acquisition dates. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed, if any, are measured at fair value on the acquisition date using the appropriate valuation method. Goodwill generated from acquisitions is recognized if the fair value of the purchase consideration transferred, or the fair value of the acquirer\u2019s interest in the acquiree if no consideration is transferred, and any noncontrolling interests is in excess of the net fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. In determining the fair value of identifiable assets, we use various valuation techniques which require us to make estimates and assumptions surrounding projected revenues and costs, future growth, and discount rates. Goodwill   Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration transferred, or the fair value of the acquirer\u2019s interest in the acquiree if no consideration is transferred, and any noncontrolling interests over the net fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed in business combinations. Goodwill is not amortized but is subject to an annual impairment test. We perform our annual goodwill impairment assessment on the first day of the fourth quarter. Tests are performed more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. Goodwill is recorded in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet. Other Intangible Assets   Other intangible assets include finite-lived intangible assets, which mainly consist of customer relationships, reacquired rights, and backlog. These assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are tested for impairment using a similar methodology to our property and equipment, as described below.

Recoverability is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to the future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Impairments of long-lived assets during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 were not material. Palantir Technologies Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)   Leases   The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. An arrangement is or contains a lease if it conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. If a lease is identified, classification is determined at lease commencement. Operating lease liabilities are recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease commencement date. The Company\u2019s leases do not provide an implicit interest rate and therefore the Company estimates its incremental borrowing rate to discount lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate reflects the interest rate that the Company would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment over a similar term. Operating lease right-of-use (\u201cROU\u201d) assets are based on the corresponding lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before commencement, initial direct costs, and lease incentives. Renewals or early terminations are not accounted for unless the Company is reasonably certain to exercise these options. Operating lease expense is recognized and the ROU asset is amortized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company has lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are accounted for as a single lease component. For short-term leases, defined as leases with a term of twelve months or less, the Company elected the practical expedient to not recognize an associated lease liability and ROU asset. Lease payments for short-term leases are expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use assets, operating lease liabilities, and operating lease liabilities, non-current on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are not material. Fair Value Measurement   Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability, or an exit price, in the principal or most advantageous market for that asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.",

A financial instrument\u2019s level within the three-level hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The three-level hierarchy of inputs is as follows:   Level 1: Observable inputs such as unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date;   Level 2: Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities; and   Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. These inputs are based on the Company\u2019s own assumptions about current market conditions and require significant management judgment or estimation. Financial instruments consist of money market funds and certificates of deposit included in cash equivalents and restricted cash, accounts receivable, marketable securities, other assets accounted for at fair value, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities. Money market funds, certificates of deposit, and marketable securities are stated at fair value on a recurring basis. Accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities are stated at their carrying value, which approximates fair value due to the short time to the expected receipt or payment date. Revenue Recognition   The Company generates revenue from the sale of subscriptions to access its software platforms in the Company\u2019s hosted environment, along with ongoing operations and maintenance (\u201cO&M\u201d) services (\u201cPalantir Cloud\u201d); software licenses, primarily term licenses in the customers\u2019 environments, with ongoing O&M services (\u201cOn-Premises Software\u201d); and professional services. In accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , the Company recognizes revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for promised goods or services.

Additionally, the pricing of the Company\u2019s contracts is generally fixed; however, it is possible for contracts to include variable consideration, which can be based on subjective or objective criteria. The Company includes the estimated amount of variable consideration that it expects to receive to the extent it is probable that a significant revenue reversal will not occur. Each of the Company\u2019s significant performance obligations and the Company\u2019s application of ASC 606 to its revenue arrangements is discussed in further detail below. Palantir Cloud   The Company\u2019s Palantir Cloud subscriptions grant customers the right to access the software functionality in a hosted environment controlled by Palantir and are sold together with stand-ready O&M services, as further described below. The Company agrees to provide continuous access to its hosted software platforms throughout the contract term. Revenue associated with Palantir Cloud subscriptions is generally recognized over the contract term on a ratable basis, which is consistent with the transfer of control of the Palantir Cloud subscription to the customer. On-Premises Software   Sales of the Company\u2019s software licenses, primarily term licenses, grant customers the right to use functional intellectual property, either on their internal hardware infrastructure or on their own cloud instance, over the contractual term and are also sold together with stand-ready O&M services. The O&M services include critical updates, support, and maintenance services required to operate the software and, as such, are necessary for the software to maintain its intended utility over the contractual term. Because of this requirement, the Company has concluded that the software licenses and O&M services, which together the Company refers to as On-Premises Software, are highly interdependent and interrelated and represent a single distinct performance obligation within the context of the contract. Revenue is generally recognized over the contract term on a ratable basis. Professional Services   The Company\u2019s professional services support the customers\u2019 use of the software platforms and include, as needed, on-demand user support, user-interface configuration, training, and ongoing ontology and data modeling support. Professional services contracts typically include the provision of on-demand professional services for the duration of the contractual term.",

Professional services are on-demand, whereby the Company performs services throughout the contract period; therefore, the revenue is recognized over the contractual term. Contract Liabilities   The timing of customer billings and payments relative to the start of the service period varies from contract to contract; however, the Company bills many of its customers in advance of the provision of services under its contracts, resulting in contract liabilities consisting of either deferred revenue or customer deposits (\u201ccontract liabilities\u201d). Deferred revenue represents billings under noncancelable contracts before the related product or service is transferred to the customer. Customer deposits consist of amounts billed and/or paid in advance of the start of the contractual term or for anticipated revenue generating activities for the portion of a contract term that is subject to cancellation by its customers. Many of the Company\u2019s arrangements include terms that allow the customer to terminate the contract for convenience and receive a pro-rata refund of the amount of the customer deposit for the period of time remaining in the contract term after the applicable termination notice period expires. In these arrangements, the Company concluded there are no enforceable rights and obligations after such notice period and therefore the consideration received or due from the customer that is subject to termination for convenience is recorded as customer deposits. The payment terms and conditions vary by contract; however, the Company\u2019s terms generally require payment within 30 to 60 days from the invoice date.

As such, the Company determined its contracts do not generally contain a significant financing component. Areas of Judgment and Estimation   The Company\u2019s contracts with customers can include multiple promises to transfer goods or services to the customer. Determining whether promises are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately \u2013 or not distinct within the context of the contract and, thus, accounted for together \u2013 requires significant judgment.",

Significant estimates and assumptions are used in the identification of performance obligations in customer contracts and collectability of contract consideration, including accounts receivable. Estimates and judgments are based on historical experience, forecasted events, and various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates and such differences could affect our financial position and results of operations. Costs to Obtain and Fulfill Contracts   Incremental costs of obtaining a contract include only those costs that are directly related to the acquisition of contracts, including sales commissions, and that would not have been incurred if the contract had not been obtained. The Company recognizes a contract cost asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if it is expected that the economic benefit and amortization period will be longer than one year. Costs to obtain contracts were not material in the periods presented. The Company recognizes an asset for the costs to fulfill a contract with a customer if the costs are specifically identifiable, generate or enhance resources used to satisfy future performance obligations, and are expected to be recovered. Costs to fulfill contracts were not material in the periods presented. Software Development Costs   The Company evaluates capitalization of certain software development costs subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility. Based on the Company\u2019s product development process and substantial development risks, technological feasibility is generally established for the Company\u2019s products when they are made available for general release. Accordingly, most costs are charged to research and development expense in the period incurred. Cost of Revenue   Cost of revenue primarily includes salaries, stock-based compensation expense, and benefits for personnel involved in performing O&M and professional services, as well as field service representatives, third-party cloud hosting services, travel costs, allocated overhead, and other direct costs. Sales and Marketing Costs   Sales and marketing costs primarily include salaries, stock-based compensation expense, commissions, and benefits for the sales force and personnel involved in sales functions, executing on pilots, including bootcamps, and performing other brand building and customer growth activities, as well as third-party cloud hosting services for pilots, marketing and sales event-related costs, travel costs, and allocated overhead.",

Research and Development Costs   Research and development costs primarily include salaries, stock-based compensation expense, and benefits for personnel involved in performing the activities to develop and refine the Company\u2019s platforms and products, as well as third-party cloud hosting services and other IT related costs, travel costs, and allocated overhead. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Commitments and Contingencies   Palantir Technologies Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)   Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, disputes, legal proceedings, fines and penalties, and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been or will be incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. Legal costs incurred in connection with loss contingencies are expensed as incurred. Recoveries of such legal costs from insurance policies are recorded as an offset to legal expenses in the period they are received. Stock-Based Compensation   The Company accounts for stock-based compensation expense in accordance with the fair value recognition and measurement provisions of GAAP, which require compensation cost for the grant-date fair value of stock-based awards to be recognized over the requisite service period. The Company determines the fair value of stock-based awards granted or modified on the grant date or modification date using appropriate valuation techniques. The Company recognizes forfeitures as they occur. Service-Based Vesting   The Company grants RSUs and stock option awards that vest based upon the satisfaction of only a service condition. For RSUs, the Company determines the grant-date fair value of the RSUs as the fair value of the Company\u2019s common stock on the grant date. The Company records stock-based compensation expense for stock options and RSUs that vest based upon the satisfaction of only a service condition on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally one to four years . For stock option awards, the Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of the stock options granted. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected term of the option, the expected volatility of the price of the common stock, risk-free interest rates, and the expected dividend yield of the common stock.

The performance-based vesting condition for the RSUs granted prior to September 30, 2020, the date the Company completed a direct listing of its Class A common stock on the New York Stock Exchange (the \u201cDirect Listing\u201d) was satisfied upon the occurrence of the Company\u2019s Direct Listing. For performance-based RSUs granted after the Direct Listing (\u201cP-RSUs\u201d), the Company recognizes expense from the number of P-RSUs expected to vest, determined based on the level of achievement against certain performance conditions, over the requisite service period when it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved. The probability of achievement is assessed periodically to determine whether the performance metric continues to be probable. When there is a change in the assessment of the probability of achievement, any cumulative effect of the change is recognized in the period of the change and any remaining expense of the related awards is amortized over the remaining service period. Employee Benefit Plan   The Company sponsors a 401(k) tax-deferred savings plan for all employees who meet certain eligibility requirements. Participants may contribute, on a pretax and post-tax basis, a percentage of their qualifying annual compensation, but not to exceed a maximum contribution amount pursuant to Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. The Company may make additional matching contributions on behalf of the participants. The Company did not make matching contributions for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021.   Income Taxes   The Company estimates its current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items not currently deductible for tax purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets, which are estimated based upon the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates that will be in effect when these differences reverse. In general, deferred tax assets represent future tax benefits to be received when certain expenses previously recognized in the Company\u2019s consolidated statements of operations become deductible expenses under applicable income tax laws or loss or credit carryforwards are utilized.",

The Company considers all evidence, both positive and negative, in determining any required valuation allowance and evaluates the need for a valuation allowance on a regular basis. The Company performs an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely   Palantir Technologies Inc.

As such, the Company has presented the net income (loss) attributed to its common stock on a combined basis. Noncontrolling Interests   A noncontrolling interest represents the proportionate equity interest in a subsidiary that is not attributable, either directly or indirectly, to the Company and is reported as equity of the Company, separate from the Company\u2019s controlling interest.

Revenue of $ 329.4 million and $ 384.3 million was recognized during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, that was included in the contract liabilities balances as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Remaining Performance Obligations   The Company\u2019s arrangements with its customers often have terms that span over multiple years. However, the Company allows many of its customers to terminate contracts for convenience prior to the end of the stated term with less than twelve months\u2019 notice. Revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations represents noncancelable contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized, which includes deferred revenue and, in certain instances, amounts that will be invoiced. The Company has elected the practical expedient allowing the Company to not disclose remaining performance obligations for contracts with original terms of twelve months or less. Cancelable contracted revenue, which includes customer deposits, is not considered a remaining performance obligation. The Company\u2019s remaining performance obligations were $ 1.2 billion as of December 31, 2023, of which the Company expects to recognize approximately 52 % as revenue over the next 12 months, 37 % as revenue over the subsequent 13 to 36 months, and the remainder thereafter. Disaggregation of Revenue   See Note 13. Segment and Geographic Information for disaggregated revenue by customer segment and geographic region. 4.

    "text": "14. Business Combinations   On November 8, 2022, the Company gained the right to majority representation on the board of directors of Palantir Japan, thereby obtaining a controlling interest. Prior to obtaining a controlling interest, the Company accounted for its 50 % ownership in Palantir Japan as an equity method investment, which was created to distribute Palantir platforms to the Japanese market. This transaction was accounted for as a \u201cstep acquisition\u201d (as defined by U.S. GAAP), as such, the Company remeasured its pre-existing equity interest in Palantir Japan immediately prior to the completion of the acquisition to its estimated fair value. The results of Palantir Japan have been included in the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date, with the portion outside of its control forming a noncontrolling interest.   The fair value of Palantir Japan on the acquisition date totaled $ 149.0 million, which included the Company\u2019s equity interest immediately prior to the acquisition of $ 74.5 million and the noncontrolling interest of $ 74.5 million. The amounts recognized of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date included: cash of $ 66.7 million; goodwill of $ 36.1 million; intangible assets of $ 34.7 million related to customer relationships, reacquired rights, and backlog; $ 32.5 million of other identifiable assets; and $ 21.0 million of net liabilities. The intangible assets are reported in other assets and are being amortized over a period of two to seven years in accordance with the underlying pattern of economic benefit reflected by the future net cash flows. Goodwill is reported in other assets and is primarily attributed to the value expected from synergies resulting from the Palantir Japan acquisition. None of the goodwill recognized is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.   In accordance with accounting for a step acquisition, the Company recognized a gain of $ 44.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 as a result of remeasuring its pre-existing interest in Palantir Japan held immediately before the business combination, which was included in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations.   15.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current plans, expectations, and beliefs, involving risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. You should review the section titled \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d for a discussion of forward-looking statements and the section titled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d for a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any period in the future. This section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K generally discusses fiscal years 2022 and 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between fiscal years 2022 and 2021. Discussions of fiscal year 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between fiscal years 2021 and 2020 that are not included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K can be found in Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, which was filed with the SEC on February 24, 2022 and is incorporated herein by reference. Overview   We build software that empowers organizations to effectively integrate their data, decisions, and operations at scale. We were founded in 2003 and started building software for the intelligence community in the United States to assist in counterterrorism investigations and operations. We later began working with commercial enterprises, who often faced fundamentally similar challenges in working with data. We have built three principal software platforms, Gotham, Foundry, and Apollo. Gotham and Foundry enable institutions to transform massive amounts of information into an integrated data asset that reflects their operations. For over a decade, Gotham   has surfaced insights for global defense agencies, the intelligence community, disaster relief organizations and beyond. Foundry is becoming a central operating system not only for individual institutions but also for entire industries. Apollo, which we began offering as a commercial solution in 2021, is a cloud-agnostic, single control layer that coordinates ongoing delivery of new features, security updates, and platform configurations, helping to ensure the continuous operation of critical systems.",

    "text": "Apollo allows our customers to run their software in virtually any environment. While our focus in the short term remains on making our principal software platforms available to increasingly broad swaths of the market, we are also working to identify additional component parts and products embedded within those platforms that have potential as commercial offerings on their own. We believe that every institution faces challenges that our platforms and products were designed to address. Our approach with all our clients is to establish a partnership that transforms the way they use data in pursuit of their goals. We regularly evaluate partnerships and investment opportunities in complementary businesses, employee teams, technologies, and intellectual property rights in an effort to expand our product and service offerings. Our Business   Our customers pay us to use the software platforms we have built. While we generally offer contract terms of one to five years in length, our customers sometimes enter into shorter-term contracts. Revenue is generally recognized ratably over the contract term. Many of our customer contracts contain termination for convenience provisions. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we generated $1.9 billion in revenue, reflecting a 24% growth rate from the year ended December 31, 2021, when we generated $1.5 billion in revenue. In the year ended December 31, 2022, we incurred losses from operations of $161.2 million, or adjusted income from operations of $420.8 million when excluding stock-based compensation and related employer payroll taxes. In the year ended December 31, 2021, our losses from operations were $411.0 million, or adjusted income from operations of $473.5 million when excluding stock-based compensation and related employer payroll taxes. In the year ended December 31, 2022, our gross profit was $1.5 billion, reflecting a gross margin of 79%, or 81% when excluding stock-based compensation. In the year ended December 31, 2021, our gross profit was $1.2 billion, reflecting a gross margin of 78%, or 82% when excluding stock-based compensation. For more information about our adjusted income from operations, which excludes stock-based compensation and related employer payroll taxes; and gross profit and gross margin, when excluding stock-based compensation; as well as reconciliations from loss from operations and gross profit, see the section titled \u201cNon-GAAP Reconciliations\u201d below. Our Customers   We define a customer as an organization from which we have recognized revenue during the trailing twelve-month period. During the period ended December 31, 2022, we had 367 customers, including companies in various commercial sectors and government agencies around the world. During the period ended December 31, 2021, we had 237 customers.",

    "text": "For large government agencies, where a single institution has multiple divisions, units, or subsidiary agencies, each such division, unit, or subsidiary agency that enters into a separate contract with us and is invoiced as a separate entity is treated as a separate customer. For example, while the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and National Institutes of Health are subsidiary agencies of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, we treat each of those agencies as a separate customer given that the governing structures and procurement processes of each agency are independent. We have built lasting and significant customer relationships and partnerships with some of the world\u2019s leading government institutions and companies. As of December 31, 2022, we expect to generate revenue under our existing customer contracts for an additional 2.8 years on a dollar-weighted average contract duration basis. Dollar-weighted average contract duration represents the length of time we expect to generate revenue on average, including existing contractual obligations and assuming that our customers will exercise all of the contractual options available to them, and is subject to change as we enter into new contracts or if customers terminate for convenience. We calculate this duration on a dollar-weighted basis to adjust for smaller deals. The timing of our customer billings and receipt of payments varies from contract to contract. Our average revenue for the top twenty customers during the trailing twelve months ended December 31, 2022 was $49.4 million, which grew 13% from an average of $43.6 million in revenue from the top twenty customers during the trailing twelve months ended December 31, 2021, demonstrating our expanding relationships with existing customers. Organizations in the commercial and government sectors face similar challenges when it comes to managing data, and we intend to expand our reach in both markets moving forward. Our decisions about which customer relationships require further investment may change over time, based on our assessment of the potential long-term value that our software can generate for them. We enter into initial pilots with customers, generally at our own expense and without a guarantee of future returns, in order to access a unique set of opportunities that others may pass over for lack of resources and shorter investment horizons. We manage customers at the account level, not by industry or sector, so that we can optimize on the specific growth opportunities for each customer. In the year ended December 31, 2022, 56% of our revenue came from government customers and 44% came from commercial customers. Our U.S. customers have been a meaningful source of revenue growth for our business. In the year ended December 31, 2022, we generated 61% of our revenue from customers in the United States and the remaining 39% from non-U.S. customers. Revenue from our U.S.",

We expect that U.S. customers will continue to be a source of significant revenue growth for us. We continue to believe that our government customers remain a meaningful and resilient source of revenue for our business, particularly during periods of economic uncertainty. However, large government customers, in particular, are generally subject to a number of uncertainties regarding budgets and spending levels, changes in timing and spending priorities, and regulatory and policy changes, which can make it difficult to predict when, or if, we will make sales to such customers or the size and scope of any contract awards. See also the discussion of \u201c Risks Related to Relationships and Business with the Public Sector\u201d within Item 1A. Risk Factors included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Expansion of Access to Platforms   The speed with which our platforms can be deployed has significantly expanded the range of potential customers with which we plan on partnering over the long term. We anticipate that our reach among an increasingly broad set of customers, in both the commercial and government sectors, will accelerate moving forward. We believe that, as these new partners grow, we will grow with them. We have also made a number of investments in companies whose businesses rely on the ability of their organizations to manage and analyze data effectively at scale. Our proximity to these businesses and the industries in which they are operating has enhanced, and is expected to continue enhancing, our own product and business development efforts, as we continue expanding access to our platforms to the broadest possible set of customers. Total Remaining Deal Value   We are focused on building strategic relationships with, and delivering significant outcomes for, our customers over the long term. Our contracts with our customers reflect that long-term orientation, often lasting for multiple years at a time. Total remaining deal value is the total remaining value of contracts that have been awarded by our government and commercial customers and includes existing contractual obligations and unexercised contract options available to those customers. Total remaining deal value presumes the exercise of all contract options and no termination of contracts; however, the majority of our contracts are subject to termination provisions, including for convenience, and there can be no guarantee that contracts are not terminated or that contract options will be exercised. Total remaining deal value also includes remaining contract value from Strategic Commercial Contracts, which are subject to termination for cause provisions.",

As of December 31, 2022, the total remaining deal value of the contracts, as defined above, was $3.7 billion, down 3% from December 31, 2021, when our total remaining deal value of such contracts was $3.8 billion. Of our total remaining deal value, as of December 31, 2022, the total remaining deal value of the contracts that we entered into with commercial customers, including existing contractual obligations and available contractual options, as defined above, was $2.0 billion, down 23% from December 31, 2021, when the total remaining deal value of such contracts was $2.6 billion. The decrease was due to the exclusion of certain contracts, as described above, as well as decreases resulting from the recognition of revenue and renegotiation of a commercial contract. As of December 31, 2022, the total remaining deal value of the contracts that we had been awarded by government agencies in the United States and allied countries around the world, including existing contractual obligations and contractual options   available to those government agencies, was $1.7 billion, up 37% from December 31, 2021, when the total value of such contracts was $1.2 billion. When calculating the total remaining deal value of government contracts, we do not include government contracts known as IDIQ contracts, totaling $2.8 billion, as of December 31, 2022, that we have been awarded, but where the funding of such contracts has not yet been determined. The funding of these contracts is not guaranteed. Many of our government and commercial contracts are subject to termination for convenience provisions. Additionally, the U.S. federal government is prohibited from exercising contract options more than one year in advance. As a result, there can be no guarantee that our customer contracts will not be terminated or that contract options will be exercised. Macroeconomic Trends   As a corporation with an international presence, we are subject to risks and uncertainties caused by significant events with macroeconomic impacts, including, but not limited to, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the impact of the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, rising inflation and interest rates, monetary policy changes, and foreign currency fluctuations. Additionally, these macroeconomic impacts have generally disrupted the operations of our customers and prospective customers. We continuously monitor the direct and indirect impacts of these circumstances on our business and financial results, as well as the overall global economy and geopolitical landscape.",

COVID-19 Impact   The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact the global economy. The extent to which COVID-19 may impact our financial conditions or results of operations in future periods remains uncertain, but to date has not had a material adverse impact on our results of operations. We continue to prioritize the health and safety of our employees, our customers, and the communities in which we operate. We have reopened our offices and have allowed business travel and in-person events to resume, while continuing to closely monitor developments around the evolving nature of the pandemic. As such, our travel and office-related expenditures have increased, and may continue to increase moving forward. However, we expect that some of our employees will continue to work remotely. The economic effects of the pandemic and resulting societal changes are currently not predictable. The COVID-19 pandemic has made clear to many of our customers that accommodating the extended timelines ordinarily required to realize results from implementing new software solutions is not an option during a crisis. As a result, customers are increasingly adopting our software, which can be ready in days, over internal software development efforts, which may take months or years. Russia-Ukraine Conflict   We continue to closely monitor the impact of the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict and its global impacts on our business. While the conflict is still evolving and the outcome remains highly uncertain, we do not expect that the Russian invasion will have a material impact on our business and results of operations. We do not currently have office locations in Russia and none of our revenues came from sales to entities headquartered in Russia. In June 2022, our Chief Executive Officer, Alexander Karp, met with the President of Ukraine and other senior officials to discuss opening an office in Ukraine and providing ongoing support. Our current operations related to Ukraine are not material to our financial position or results of operations. However, if the conflict continues or worsens, leading to greater disruptions and uncertainty within the technology industry or global economy, our business and results of operations could be negatively impacted. Foreign Currency Exchange Rates   Exchange rates are subject to significant and rapid fluctuations due to a number of factors, including interest rate changes and political and economic uncertainty which may adversely affect our results of operations or financial position. Our contracts with customers are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. As a result, the general strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other major foreign currencies (primarily the Euro and GBP) had an unfavorable impact on our revenues from certain non-U.S.",

Customer Impacts   Current macroeconomic conditions may also adversely impact our customers\u2019 business, particularly our early- and growth-stage customers. Relationships with early- or growth-stage customers carry inherent risks because, among other things, such customers may be unable to generate sufficient revenues or profitability or to access any necessary financing or funding in a timely manner or on favorable terms to them in the current macroeconomic environment, which has impacted, and may continue to impact, our expected revenue and collections. As a result, current macroeconomic conditions may continue to impact our ability to realize the full value of our commercial contracts with such early- or growth-stage customers. For additional information see Note 4. Investments and Fair Value Measurements in the consolidated financials statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Key Business Measure   In addition to the measures presented in our consolidated financial statements, we use the following key non-GAAP business measure to help us evaluate our business, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans and financial projections, and make strategic decisions. Contribution Margin   We believe that the revenue we generate relative to the costs we incur in order to generate such revenue is an important measure of the efficiency of our business. We define contribution margin as revenue less our cost of revenue and sales and marketing expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, divided by revenue. Revenue is allocated to each customer account directly. The cost of revenue and sales and marketing costs include both the costs associated with the deployment and operation of our software as well as expenses associated with identifying new customers and expanding partnerships with existing ones. Our software engineers working with existing customers often manage the deployment and operation of our platforms as well as identify new ways that those platforms can be used. To calculate the contribution by segment, we allocate cost of revenue and sales and marketing expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, to an account pro rata based on headcount and time spent on the account during the period. To the extent certain costs or personnel are not directly assigned to a specific account, they are allocated pro rata based on total headcount staffed during such period. Direct costs, such as third-party cloud hosting services, are directly allocated to the account to which they relate. Allocated revenues and expenses are then aggregated into a segment based upon the customer account to which they relate.",

    "text": "Contribution margin, both across our business and segments, is intended to capture how much we have earned from customers after accounting for the costs associated with deploying and operating our software, as well as any sales and marketing expenses involved in acquiring and expanding our partnerships with those customers, including allocated overhead. We exclude stock-based compensation as it is a non-cash expense. We believe that our contribution margin provides an important measure of the efficiency of our operations over time. We have included contribution margin because it is a key measure used by our management to evaluate our performance, and we believe that it also provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management team. Our calculation of contribution margin may differ from similarly titled measures, if any, reported by other companies. Contribution margin should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. For more information about contribution margin, including the limitations of this measure, and a reconciliation to loss from operations, see the section titled \u201cNon-GAAP Reconciliations\u201d below. Non-GAAP Reconciliations   We use the non-GAAP measures contribution margin; gross profit and gross margin, excluding stock-based compensation; and adjusted income from operations, which excludes stock-based compensation and related employer payroll taxes to help us evaluate our business, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans and financial projections, and make strategic decisions. We exclude stock-based compensation, which is a non-cash expense, from these non-GAAP financial measures because we believe that excluding this item provides meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management team. Additionally, we exclude employer payroll taxes related to stock-based compensation as it is difficult to predict and outside of our control. Our definitions may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. In addition, other companies may not publish these or similar metrics. Further, these metrics have certain limitations, as they do not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our consolidated statement of operations. Thus, our non-GAAP contribution margin; gross profit and gross margin, excluding stock-based compensation; and adjusted income from operations should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. We compensate for these limitations by providing reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures.",

    "text": "Components of Results of Operations   Revenue   We generate revenue from the sale of subscriptions to access our software in our hosted environment along with ongoing O&M services (\u201cPalantir Cloud\u201d), software subscriptions in our customers\u2019 environments with ongoing O&M services (\u201cOn-Premises Software\u201d), and professional services. Palantir Cloud   Our Palantir Cloud subscriptions grant customers the right to access the software functionality in a hosted environment controlled by Palantir and are sold together with stand-ready O&M services, as further described below. We promise to provide continuous access to the hosted software throughout the contract term. Revenue associated with Palantir Cloud subscriptions is generally recognized over the contract term on a ratable basis, which is consistent with the transfer of control of the Palantir services to the customer. On-Premises Software   Sales of our software subscriptions grant customers the right to use functional intellectual property, either on their internal hardware infrastructure or on their own cloud instance, over the contractual term and are also sold together with stand-ready O&M services. O&M services include critical updates and support and maintenance services required to operate the software and, as such, are necessary for the software to maintain its intended utility over the contractual term. Because of this requirement, we have concluded that the software subscriptions and O&M services, which together we refer to as our On-Premises Software, are highly interdependent and interrelated and represent a single distinct performance obligation within the context of the contract. Revenue is generally recognized over the contract term on a ratable basis. Professional Services   Our professional services support the customers\u2019 use of the software and include, as needed, on-demand user support, user-interface configuration, training, and ongoing ontology and data modeling support. Professional services contracts typically include the provision of on-demand professional services for the duration of the contractual term. These services are typically coterminous with a Palantir Cloud or On-Premises Software subscriptions. Professional services are on-demand, whereby we perform services throughout the contract period; therefore, the revenue is recognized over the contractual term. Cost of Revenue   Cost of revenue primarily includes salaries, stock-based compensation expense, and benefits for personnel involved in performing O&M and professional services, as well as field service representatives, third-party cloud hosting services, travel costs, allocated overhead, and other direct costs. We expect that cost of revenue will increase in absolute dollars as our revenue grows and will vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue.",

Segments   We have two operating segments, commercial and government, which were determined based on the manner in which the chief operating decision maker (\u201cCODM\u201d), who is our chief executive officer, manages our operations for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating performance. Various factors, including our organizational and management reporting structure and customer type, were considered in determining these operating segments. Our operating segments are described below:   \u2022 Commercial: This segment primarily serves customers working in non-government industries. \u2022 Government: This segment primarily serves customers that are U.S. government and non-U.S. government agencies. Segment profitability is evaluated based on contribution and contribution margin. Contribution is segment revenue less the related costs of revenue and sales and marketing expenses, excluding stock-based compensation expense. Contribution margin is contribution divided by revenue. To the extent costs of revenue or sales and marketing expenses are not directly attributable to a particular segment, they are allocated based upon headcount at each operating segment during the period. We use it, in part, to evaluate the performance of, and allocate resources to, each of our operating segments, which excludes certain operating expenses that are not allocated to operating segments because they are separately managed at the consolidated corporate level. These unallocated costs include stock-based compensation expense, research and development costs, and general and administrative costs, such as legal and accounting.",

    "text": "Provision for income taxes decreased by $21.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to the prior year establishment of a full valuation allowance against its U.K. deferred tax assets during the fourth quarter of 2021 partially offset by permanent differences associated with U.S. Base Erosion and Anti Abuse Tax elections. The Company maintains a full valuation allowance against its U.S. federal and state and U.K. deferred tax assets. For additional information see Note 11. Income Taxes in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Liquidity and Capital Resources   We generated positive cash flow from operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 and had $2.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents available as of December 31, 2022. We believe that cash flows generated from operations, cash, cash equivalents, available funds and access to financing sources, including our credit facility, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next twelve months. However, any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. We have generated significant losses from our operations as reflected in our consolidated balance sheets and we expect cash flow from operations may fluctuate for the foreseeable future. Historically, we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of our equity securities, including proceeds from option exercises, and payments received from our customers. As of December 31, 2022, our accumulated deficit balance was $5.9 billion, and our principal sources of liquidity were $2.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents. During April 2021, we repaid our outstanding term loans of $200.0 million. As of December 31, 2022, we had no outstanding debt balances and additional available and undrawn revolving and DDTL commitments of $950.0 million under our credit agreement to fund working capital and general corporate expenditures. No amounts were drawn as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For more information, see Note 6. Debt in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to the rate of our growth, our ability to attract and retain customers and their willingness and ability to pay for our products and services, and the timing and extent of spending to support our efforts to market and develop our products. Further, we may enter into future arrangements to acquire or invest in businesses, products, services, strategic partnerships, and technologies. As such, we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all.",

    "text": "Operating Activities   Net cash provided by operating activities was $223.7 million and $333.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease was primarily driven by timing of payments to vendors and timing of the receipt of payments from our customers.   Investing Activities   Net cash used in investing activities was $45.4 million and $397.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to a reduction of our purchases of alternative investments and marketable securities, as well as increases from cash acquired from business combinations and sales or redemption of certain marketable securities.   Financing Activities   Net cash provided by financing activities was $86.0 million and $306.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease in cash provided by financing activities was driven by a decrease in proceeds from the exercise of common stock options, partially offset by the principal repayments on borrowings of $200.0 million made during the year ended December 31, 2021.

Opinion on the Financial Statements   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Palantir Technologies Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, redeemable convertible and convertible preferred stock and stockholders\u2019 equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \u201cconsolidated financial statements\u201d). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 21, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion   These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.",

    "text": "Critical Audit Matter   The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.Revenue Recognition Description of the Matter As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company generates its revenue primarily from the sale of subscriptions to access its software in the Company\u2019s hosted environment, along with ongoing operations and maintenance (\u201cO&M\u201d) services (\u201cPalantir Cloud\u201d); software licenses, primarily term licenses in the customers\u2019 environments, with ongoing O&M services (\u201cOn-Premises Software\u201d); and professional services. Management applies significant judgment in identifying and evaluating any non-standard terms and conditions in customer arrangements which may impact the determination of performance obligations or the timing of revenue recognition. In addition, the determining whether promises are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately \u2013 or not distinct within the context of the contract and, thus, accounted for together \u2013 requires significant judgment. The Company concluded that the promise to provide a software license is highly interdependent and interrelated with the promise to provide O&M services and such promises are not distinct within the context of its contracts and are accounted for as a single performance obligation for the Company\u2019s On-Premises Software. Auditing revenue recognition was complex and required a significant level of auditor judgment to identify and evaluate non-standard terms and conditions that impact revenue recognition and to assess whether the software licenses and O&M services should be accounted for as distinct performance obligations or combined as a single performance obligation. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company\u2019s controls to identify and evaluate terms and conditions and performance obligations in customer arrangements that would impact revenue recognition.",

In addition, we evaluated management\u2019s key assumptions and analysis of its performance obligations, including their assessment of the nature, interdependency, and level of integration between the software license and O&M services.

San Jose, California   February 21, 2023   Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm   To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Palantir Technologies Inc. Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   We have audited Palantir Technologies Inc.\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control\u2014Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Palantir Technologies Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the COSO criteria. As indicated in the accompanying Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management\u2019s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Palantir Technologies Japan K.K, which is included in the 2022 consolidated financial statements of the Company and constituted 0.3% and 0.1% of total and net assets, respectively, as of December 31, 2022 and 0.4% and 0.5% of revenues and net loss, respectively, for the year then ended. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Palantir Technologies Japan K.K. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, redeemable convertible and convertible preferred stock and stockholders\u2019 equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and our report dated February 21, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP   San Jose, California   February 21, 2023   Palantir Technologies Inc.",

Organization   Palantir Technologies Inc. (including its subsidiaries, \u201cPalantir\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) was incorporated in Delaware on May 6, 2003. The Company builds and deploys software platforms that serve as the central operating systems for its customers. 2. Significant Accounting Policies   Basis of Presentation and Consolidation   The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) and applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding annual financial reporting. The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Palantir Technologies Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Investments in entities where the Company holds at least a 20% ownership interest and has the ability to exercise significant influence over, but does not control, the investee are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. For such investments, the share of the investee\u2019s results of operations is included as a component of other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations and the investment balance is included in other assets and classified as noncurrent in the consolidated balance sheets. Certain prior year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Such reclassifications did not affect total revenues, loss from operations, net loss, or cash flows. The Company\u2019s fiscal year ends on December 31.   Direct Listing   On September 30, 2020, the Company completed a direct listing of its Class A common stock on the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d) (the \u201cDirect Listing\u201d). Immediately prior to the Direct Listing, all outstanding shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock and convertible preferred stock were converted into Class B common stock, and all of the Company\u2019s outstanding preferred stock warrants were converted into common stock warrants, which resulted in the reclassification of the warrants liability to additional paid-in capital. Use of Estimates   The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods.",

    "text": "Significant estimates and assumptions made in the accompanying consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to, the identification of performance obligations in customer contracts; the valuation of deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions; the collectability of contract consideration, including accounts receivable; the useful lives of tangible assets; the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed from business combinations, including intangible assets and goodwill; and the incremental borrowing rate for operating leases. Estimates and judgments are based on historical experience, forecasted events, and various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and such differences could affect the Company\u2019s financial position and results of operations. Segments   The Company has two operating segments, commercial and government, which were determined based on the manner in which the chief operating decision maker (\u201cCODM\u201d), who is the chief executive officer, manages the operations of the Company for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating performance. Various factors, including the Company\u2019s organizational and management reporting structure and customer type, were considered in determining these operating segments. The Company\u2019s operating segments are described below:   \u2022 Commercial: This segment primarily serves customers working in non-government industries. \u2022 Government: This segment primarily serves customers that are United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) government and non-U.S. government agencies. Palantir Technologies Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)   Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash   The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents primarily consist of amounts invested in money market funds. Restricted cash primarily consists of cash and certificates of deposit that are held as collateral against letters of credit and guarantees that the Company is required to maintain for operating lease agreements, certain customer contracts, and other guarantees and financing arrangements. The following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash reported within the consolidated balance sheets that sum to the total of the amounts shown in the consolidated statements of cash flows (in thousands):As of December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,598,540   $ 2,290,674   $ 2,011,323   Restricted cash 16,244   36,628   37,285   Restricted cash, noncurrent 12,551   39,612   79,538   Total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash $ 2,627,335   $ 2,366,914   $ 2,128,146",

    "text": "Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses   Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount, net of an allowance for credit losses. The Company generally grants non-collateralized credit terms to its customers. Allowance for credit losses is based on the Company\u2019s best estimate of probable losses inherent in its accounts receivable portfolio and is determined based on expectations of the customer\u2019s ability to pay by considering factors such as customer type (commercial or government), historical experience, financial position of the customer, age of the accounts receivable, current economic conditions, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and reasonable and supportable forward-looking factors about its portfolio and future economic conditions. Accounts receivable are written-off and charged against an allowance for credit losses when the Company has exhausted collection efforts without success. Based upon the Company\u2019s assessment as of December 31, 2022 the Company recorded an allowance for credit losses of $ 10.1 million. Based upon the Company\u2019s assessment as of December 31, 2021, the allowances for credit losses were not material. Concentrations of Credit Risk   Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, and marketable securities. Cash equivalents primarily consist of money market funds with original maturities of three months or less, which are invested primarily with U.S. financial institutions. Cash deposits with financial institutions, including restricted cash, generally exceed federally insured limits. Management believes minimal credit risk exists with respect to these financial institutions and the Company has not experienced any losses on such amounts. The Company is exposed to concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable presented on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company\u2019s accounts receivable balances as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 were $ 258.3 million and $ 190.9 million, respectively. No customer represented more than 10% of total accounts receivable as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.   For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, no customer represented 10% or more of total revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2020, Customer F, which is in the government operating segment, represented 10 % of total revenue. No other customers represented more than 10% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020.   Alternative Investments   Alternative investments include gold bars and are recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets. The investments are initially recorded at cost and subsequently remeasured at the lower of cost or market each reporting period. Market value is determined by using quoted market prices of identical or similar assets from active markets.",

Realized gains and losses are recorded in other income (expense), net upon realization. Palantir Technologies Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)   Property and Equipment, Net   Property and equipment, net are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is recognized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, which are generally three years . Leasehold improvements are capitalized and amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful life, which is generally five years . Maintenance and repairs that do not improve or extend the useful lives of the assets are expensed when incurred. Upon sale or retirement of assets, the cost and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are derecognized from the consolidated balance sheet and any resulting gain or loss is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations in the period realized. Privately-held Securities   Equity securities in private-held companies without readily determinable fair values are recorded using the measurement alternative. Such investments are carried at cost, less any impairments, and are adjusted for subsequent observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. Changes in the basis of the equity securities are recognized in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. Business Combinations   Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) 805, Business Combinations, and are included in our consolidated financial statements from their respective acquisition dates. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed, if any, are measured at fair value on the acquisition date using the appropriate valuation method. Goodwill generated from acquisitions is recognized if the fair value of the purchase consideration transferred, or the fair value of the acquirer\u2019s interest in the acquiree if no consideration is transferred, and any noncontrolling interests is in excess of the net fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. In determining the fair value of identifiable assets, we use various valuation techniques which require us to make estimates and assumptions surrounding projected revenues and costs, future growth, and discount rates. Goodwill   Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration transferred, or the fair value of the acquirer\u2019s interest in the acquiree if no consideration is transferred, and any noncontrolling interests over the net fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed in business combinations.",

    "text": "Goodwill is not amortized but is subject to an annual impairment test. We perform our annual goodwill impairment assessment on the first day of the fourth quarter. Tests are performed more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. Goodwill is recorded in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet. Other Intangible Assets   Other intangible assets include finite-lived intangible assets, which mainly consist of customer relationships, reacquired rights, and backlog. These assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are tested for impairment using a similar methodology to our property and equipment, as described below. Other intangible assets are recorded in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets   Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to the future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Impairments of long-lived assets during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 were not material. Leases   The Company adopted the Accounting Standard Update (\u201cASU\u201d) 2016-02, Leases, and additional ASUs issued to clarify and update the guidance in ASU 2016-02 (collectively \u201cASC 842\u201d), as of January 1, 2020.   The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. An arrangement is or contains a lease if it conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. If a lease is identified, classification is determined at lease commencement. Operating lease liabilities are recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease commencement date. The Company\u2019s leases do not provide an implicit interest rate and therefore the Company estimates its incremental borrowing rate to discount lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate reflects the   Palantir Technologies Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)   interest rate that the Company would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment over a similar term. Operating lease right-of-use (\u201cROU\u201d) assets are based on the corresponding lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before commencement, initial direct costs, and lease incentives. Renewals or early terminations are not accounted for unless the Company is reasonably certain to exercise these options.",

The Company has lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are accounted for as a single lease component. The Company elected to use the transition relief package of practical expedients but did not elect to use the hindsight practical expedient in determining a lease term and impairment of ROU assets at the adoption date. For short-term leases, defined as leases with a term of twelve months or less, the Company elected the practical expedient to not recognize an associated lease liability and ROU asset. Lease payments for short-term leases are expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use assets, operating lease liabilities, and operating lease liabilities, non-current on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are not material. Fair Value Measurement   Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability, or an exit price, in the principal or most advantageous market for that asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The Company measures fair value based on a three-level hierarchy of inputs, maximizing the use of observable inputs, where available, and minimizing the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. A financial instrument\u2019s level within the three-level hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The three-level hierarchy of inputs is as follows:   Level 1: Observable inputs such as unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date;   Level 2: Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities; and   Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. These inputs are based on the Company\u2019s own assumptions about current market conditions and require significant management judgment or estimation. Financial instruments consist of money market funds and certificates of deposit included in cash equivalents and restricted cash, accounts receivable, marketable securities, other assets accounted for at fair value, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities. Money market funds, certificates of deposit, and marketable securities are stated at fair value on a recurring basis.",

Revenue Recognition   The Company generates revenue from the sale of subscriptions to access its software in the Company\u2019s hosted environment, along with ongoing operations and maintenance (\u201cO&M\u201d) services (\u201cPalantir Cloud\u201d); software licenses, primarily term licenses in the customers\u2019 environments, with ongoing O&M services (\u201cOn-Premises Software\u201d); and professional services. In accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , the Company recognizes revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for promised goods or services. The Company applies the following five-step revenue recognition model in accounting for its revenue arrangements:   \u2022 Identification of the contract(s) with the customer, including whether collectability of the consideration is probable by considering the customers\u2019 ability and intention to pay;   \u2022 Identification of the performance obligations in the contract;   \u2022 Determination of the transaction price;   \u2022 Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and   \u2022 Recognition of revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies a performance obligation. Palantir Technologies Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)   Each of the Company\u2019s significant performance obligations and the Company\u2019s application of ASC 606 to its revenue arrangements is discussed in further detail below. Palantir Cloud   The Company\u2019s Palantir Cloud subscriptions grant customers the right to access the software functionality in a hosted environment controlled by Palantir and are sold together with stand-ready O&M services, as further described below. The Company promises to provide continuous access to the hosted software throughout the contract term. Revenue associated with Palantir Cloud subscriptions is generally recognized over the contract term on a ratable basis, which is consistent with the transfer of control of the Palantir Cloud subscription to the customer. On-Premises Software   Sales of the Company\u2019s software licenses, primarily term licenses, grant customers the right to use functional intellectual property, either on their internal hardware infrastructure or on their own cloud instance, over the contractual term and are also sold together with stand-ready O&M services. The O&M services include critical updates, support, and maintenance services required to operate the software and, as such, are necessary for the software to maintain its intended utility over the contractual term.",

    "text": "Because of this requirement, the Company has concluded that the software licenses and O&M services, which together the Company refers to as On-Premises Software, are highly interdependent and interrelated and represent a single distinct performance obligation within the context of the contract. Revenue is generally recognized over the contract term on a ratable basis. Professional Services   The Company\u2019s professional services support the customers\u2019 use of the software and include, as needed, on-demand user support, user-interface configuration, training, and ongoing ontology and data modeling support. Professional services contracts typically include the provision of on-demand professional services for the duration of the contractual term. These services are typically coterminous with a Palantir Cloud subscription or the On-Premises Software. Professional services are on-demand, whereby the Company performs services throughout the contract period; therefore, the revenue is recognized over the contractual term. Contract Liabilities   The timing of customer billing and payment relative to the start of the service period varies from contract to contract; however, the Company bills many of its customers in advance of the provision of services under its contracts, resulting in contract liabilities consisting of either deferred revenue or customer deposits (\u201ccontract liabilities\u201d). Deferred revenue represents billings under noncancelable contracts before the related product or service is transferred to the customer. Customer deposits consist of amounts billed and/or paid in advance of the start of the contractual term or for anticipated revenue generating activities for the portion of a contract term that is subject to cancellation by our customers. Many of the Company\u2019s arrangements include terms that allow the customer to terminate the contract for convenience and receive a pro-rata refund of the amount of the customer deposit for the period of time remaining in the contract term after the applicable termination notice period expires. In these arrangements, the Company concluded there are no enforceable rights and obligations after such notice period and therefore the consideration received or due from the customer that is subject to termination for convenience is recorded as customer deposits. The payment terms and conditions vary by contract; however, the Company\u2019s terms generally require payment within 30 to 60 days from the invoice date. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of payment, the Company elected to apply the practical expedient in accordance with ASC 606 to not adjust contract consideration for the effects of a significant financing component as the Company expects, at contract inception, that the period between when promised goods and services are transferred to the customer and when the customer pays for those goods and services will be one year or less.",

    "text": "As such, the Company determined its contracts do not generally contain a significant financing component. Areas of Judgment and Estimation   The Company\u2019s contracts with customers can include multiple promises to transfer goods or services to the customer. Determining whether promises are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately \u2013 or not distinct within the context of the contract and, thus, accounted for together \u2013 requires significant judgment. The Company concluded that the promise to provide a software license is highly interdependent and interrelated with the promise to provide O&M services and such promises are not distinct within the context of its contracts and are accounted for as a single performance obligation as the Company\u2019s On-Premises Software. Additionally, the pricing of the Company\u2019s contracts is generally fixed; however, it is possible for contracts to include variable consideration, which can be based on subjective or objective criteria. The Company includes the estimated amount of variable   Palantir Technologies Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)   consideration that it expects to receive to the extent it is probable that a significant revenue reversal will not occur. Variable consideration received was not material in the periods presented. Costs to Obtain and Fulfill Contracts   Incremental costs of obtaining a contract include only those costs that are directly related to the acquisition of contracts, including sales commissions, and that would not have been incurred if the contract had not been obtained. The Company recognizes a contract cost asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if it is expected that the economic benefit and amortization period will be longer than one year. Costs to obtain contracts were not material in the periods presented. The Company recognizes an asset for the costs to fulfill a contract with a customer if the costs are specifically identifiable, generate or enhance resources used to satisfy future performance obligations, and are expected to be recovered. Costs to fulfill contracts were not material in the periods presented. Software Development Costs   The Company evaluates capitalization of certain software development costs subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility. Based on the Company\u2019s product development process and substantial development risks, technological feasibility is established for the Company\u2019s products when they are made available for general release. Accordingly, the Company has charged all such costs to research and development expense in the period incurred. Cost of Revenue   Cost of revenue primarily includes salaries, stock-based compensation expense, and benefits for personnel involved in performing O&M and professional services, as well as third-party cloud hosting services, travel costs, allocated overhead, and other direct costs.",

The Company generally charges all such costs to sales and marketing expense in the period incurred. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and included in sales and marketing expense within the consolidated statements of operations. Advertising expense totaled $ 38.6 million and $ 26.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and was immaterial for the year ended December 31, 2020.   Research and Development Costs   Research and development costs primarily include salaries, stock-based compensation expense, and benefits for personnel involved in performing the activities to develop and improve the Company\u2019s platforms and products, as well as third-party cloud hosting services, travel costs, and allocated overhead. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Commitments and Contingencies   Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, disputes, legal proceedings, fines and penalties, and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been or will be incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. Legal costs incurred in connection with loss contingencies are expensed as incurred. Recoveries of such legal costs from insurance policies are recorded as an offset to legal expenses in the period they are received. Stock-Based Compensation   The Company accounts for stock-based compensation expense in accordance with the fair value recognition and measurement provisions of GAAP, which require compensation cost for the grant-date fair value of stock-based awards to be recognized over the requisite service period. The Company determines the fair value of stock-based awards granted or modified on the grant date or modification date using appropriate valuation techniques. Service-Based Vesting   The Company grants RSUs and stock option awards that vest only based upon the satisfaction of a service condition. For RSUs, the Company determines the grant-date fair value of the RSUs as the fair value of the Company\u2019s common stock on the grant date. The Company records stock-based compensation expense for stock options and RSUs that vest only based upon the   Palantir Technologies Inc.

The assumptions used to determine the fair value of the option awards represent management\u2019s best estimates. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management\u2019s judgment. The Company recognizes forfeitures as they occur. Performance-Based Vesting   The Company grants awards, including RSUs, that vest upon the satisfaction of both a service condition and a performance condition. The performance-based vesting condition for the RSUs granted prior to the Company\u2019s Direct Listing was satisfied upon the occurrence of the Direct Listing and are expensed using the accelerated attribution method over the remaining service period. Employee Benefit Plan   The Company sponsors a 401(k) tax-deferred savings plan for all employees who meet certain eligibility requirements. Participants may contribute, on a pretax and post-tax basis, a percentage of their qualifying annual compensation, but not to exceed a maximum contribution amount pursuant to Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. The Company may make additional matching contributions on behalf of the participants. The Company did not make matching contributions for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020.   Income Taxes   The Company estimates its current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items not currently deductible for tax purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets, which are estimated based upon the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates that will be in effect when these differences reverse. In general, deferred tax assets represent future tax benefits to be received when certain expenses previously recognized in the Company\u2019s consolidated statements of operations become deductible expenses under applicable income tax laws or loss or credit carryforwards are utilized. Accordingly, the realization of the Company\u2019s deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income against which these deductions, losses, and credits can be utilized. The Company evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets and recognizes a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that a future benefit on such deferred tax assets will not be realized. Changes in the valuation allowance, when recorded, would be included in the Company\u2019s consolidated statements of operations. Management\u2019s judgment is required in determining the Company\u2019s valuation allowance recorded against its net deferred tax assets.",

The Company is subject to the Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (\u201cGILTI\u201d) tax in the U.S. and has elected to treat taxes on future GILTI inclusions as current period expense if and when incurred. Net Loss Per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders   The Company computes net loss per share attributable to its common stockholders using the two-class method required for participating securities, which determines net loss per common share for each class of common stock and participating securities according to dividends declared or accumulated and participation rights in distributed and undistributed earnings. The two-class method requires income available to common stockholders for the period to be allocated between common stock and participating securities based upon their respective rights to receive dividends as if all income for the period had been distributed. The rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the holders of Class A, Class B, and Class F common stock (collectively, the \u201ccommon stock\u201d) are identical, except with respect to voting and conversion. As the liquidation and dividend rights are identical, the undistributed earnings are allocated on a proportionate basis and the resulting net loss per share will, therefore, be the same for all classes of common stock on an individual or comb ined basis. As such, the Company has presented the net loss attributed to its common stock on a combined basis. Palantir Technologies Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)   Noncontrolling Interests   A noncontrolling interest represents the proportionate equity interest in a subsidiary that is not attributable, either directly or indirectly, to the Company and is reported as equity of the Company, separate from the Company\u2019s controlling interest.

Foreign Currency   Generally, the functional currency of the Company\u2019s international subsidiaries is the local currency of the country in which they operate. The Company translates the assets and liabilities of its non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end of each reporting period.

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements   In October 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations\u2014Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers (Topic 805) . The new guidance requires contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination to be recognized in accordance with ASC 606 as if the acquirer had originated the contracts. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including an adoption in an interim period. The Company adopted this standard effective October 1, 2022. The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements. 3. Contract Liabilities and Remaining Performance Obligations   Contract Liabilities   The Company\u2019s contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue and customer deposits. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company\u2019s contract liability balances were $ 339.2 million and $ 463.3 million, respectively. Revenue of $ 384.3 million and $ 378.4 million was recognized during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, that was included in the contract liabilities balances as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Remaining Performance Obligations   The Company\u2019s arrangements with its customers often have terms that span over multiple years. However, the Company allows many of its customers to terminate contracts for convenience prior to the end of the stated term with less than twelve months\u2019 notice. Revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations represents noncancelable contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized, which includes deferred revenue and, in certain instances, amounts that will be invoiced. The Company has elected the practical expedient allowing the Company to not disclose remaining performance obligations for contracts with original terms of twelve months or less. Cancelable contracted revenue, which includes customer deposits, is not considered a remaining performance obligation. The Company\u2019s remaining performance obligations were $ 972.7 million as of December 31, 2022, of which the Company expects to recognize approximately 53 % as revenue over the next 12 months, 38 % as revenue over the subsequent 13 to 36 months, and the remainder thereafter.",

Due to the absence of historical warranty claims, the Company\u2019s expectations of future claims related to products under warranty continue to be insignificant.

In the event of such a claim, the Company is generally obligated to defend its customer against the claim and to either settle the claim at the Company\u2019s expense   Palantir Technologies Inc.

    "text": "14. Business Combinations   On November 8, 2022, the Company gained the right to majority representation on the board of directors of Palantir Japan, thereby obtaining a controlling interest. Prior to obtaining a controlling interest, the Company accounted for its 50 % ownership in Palantir Japan as an equity method investment, which was created to distribute Palantir platforms to the Japanese market. This transaction was accounted for as a \u201cstep acquisition\u201d (as defined by U.S. GAAP), as such, the Company remeasured its pre-existing equity interest in Palantir Japan immediately prior to the completion of the acquisition to its estimated fair value. The results of Palantir Japan have been included in the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date, with the portion outside of its control forming a noncontrolling interest. The fair value of Palantir Japan on the acquisition date totaled $ 149.0 million, which included the Company\u2019s equity interest immediately prior to the acquisition of $ 74.5 million and the noncontrolling interest of $ 74.5 million. The amounts recognized   Palantir Technologies Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)   of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date included: cash of $ 66.7 million; goodwill of $ 36.1 million; intangible assets of $ 34.7 million related to customer relationships, reacquired rights, and backlog; $ 32.5 million of other identifiable assets; and $ 21.0 million of net liabilities. The intangible assets are reported in other assets and are being amortized over a period of two to seven years in accordance with the underlying pattern of economic benefit reflected by the future net cash flows. Goodwill is reported in other assets and is primarily attributed to the value expected from synergies resulting from the Palantir Japan acquisition. None of the goodwill recognized is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. The acquisition-date fair value of the noncontrolling and controlling equity interest was determined using a combination of the income and market approaches. With respect to intangible assets, the estimated fair values were determined based on the excess earnings method of the income approach. These models used primarily Level 3 inputs, including estimates of projected revenue growth rates, projected EBITDA margins, and an estimated discount rate. In accordance with accounting for a step acquisition, the Company recognized a gain of $ 44.3 million as a result of remeasuring its pre-existing interest in Palantir Japan held immediately before the business combination, which is included in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. The amounts of Palantir Japan\u2019s revenue and net income included in the Company\u2019s consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 were immaterial.",
